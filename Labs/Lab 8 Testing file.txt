Average: float input1 = 2, input2 = 3, input3 = 1;
	int expectedOutput = 2;
	int actualOutput = Average(input1, input2, input3);
	if (expectedOutput != actualOutput)
	{
		cout << "Fail for: " << input1 << ", " << input2 << ", " << input3 << endl;
	}
	else
	{
		cout << "Pass for: " << input1 << ", " << input2 << ", " << input3 << endl;
	}

The Average function was initially: a + b + c / 3 which is incorrect because only "c" was being divided by 3.
the correct version is (a + b + c) / 3 

Max: int input1 = 1, input2 = 2, input3 = 3;
	int expectedOutput = 3;
	int actualOutput = Max(input1, input2, input3);
		if (expectedOutput != actualOutput)
		{
			cout << "Fail for: " << input1 << ", " << input2 << ", " << input3 << endl;
		}
		else
		{
			cout << "Pass for: " << input1 << ", " << input2 << ", " << input3 << endl;
		}

The Max function was only accounting for int b being greater than int a, and if that wasn't true it would return c. It wasn't accounting for if int a was greater than either one of them.

Factorial: int input1 = 5;
	int expectedOutput = 120;
	int actualOutput = Factorial(input1);
	if (expectedOutput != actualOutput)
	{
		cout << "Fail for: " << input1 << endl;
	}
	else
	{
		cout << "Pass for: " << input1 << endl;
	}

The Factorial was including the multiplication of your initial number by itself, so 5*5 instead of 5*4 and so on.


FormatName: string input1 = "Kyle", input2 = "Walker";
	string expectedOutput = "Walker, Kyle";
	string actualOutput = FormatName(input1, input2);
	if (expectedOutput != actualOutput)
	{
		cout << "Fail for: " << input1 << ", " << input2 << ", " << expectedOutput << ", " << actualOutput << endl;
	}
	else
	{
		cout << "Pass for: " << input1 << ", " << input2 << endl;
	}

The FormatName was wrong because it wasn't adding a space after the comma. It was "," instead of ", ".
